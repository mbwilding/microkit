# microkit-macros

Procedural macros for the MicroKit library.

## Usage

This crate is automatically included when you use the `microkit` crate. You don't need to add it as a direct dependency.

The macros are re-exported through the `microkit` crate:

```rust
use microkit::prelude::*;
```

## Provided Macros

This crate provides procedural macros that simplify service creation and configuration in MicroKit.

See the [microkit](../microkit/README.md) crate for complete usage examples.
